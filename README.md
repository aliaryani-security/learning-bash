# learning-bash
I wanted to learn some basic bash scripting <br>
I thought to myself:
> why not share it with others?<br>

and so here we are.
<br><br>
I tried to comment everything and try to keep things simple.<br>
just know that whenever you create a bash script file and want to run it,<br>
<strong style="color:#FF0000;font-size:16px!important;">You just can't!</strong>
<br><br>
The reason why is that you need to make your script file executable and then try running it.

```sh
# replace FILE with your file's name
chmod +x FILE
```

That's all there's to say. have fun learning !
